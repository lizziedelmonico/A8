# A8!
This week's assignment was very fun to work on but also very frustrating at points. I still don't completely understand the file tree part of the main methodin CharacterGuess but I tried my best. I plan on working on this assignment again over break and resubmitting with (hopfully) near perfect code. Besides that, I am proud that I got the hard coded decision tree working and had a lot of fun playing around with the different characters to have the program guess. 

Characters (for context):
- Finn the human
- Princess Bubblegum (all bright pink)
- Marceline the Vampire Queen (wears all black)
- Ice King
- Flame King
- Jake (a dog)
- Tree Trunks (an elephant)
- Peppermint Butler (a smiling personified mint)
- BMO (a smiling robot)
- Lumpy Space Princess (an angry, purple blob)

TO TEST THE TREE'S ABILITY TO MEMORIZE NEW INFO:
- Cake (a cat) (yes, Cake is just Jake but a cat and is a real character)
